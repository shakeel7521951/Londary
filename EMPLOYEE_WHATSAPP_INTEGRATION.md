# Employee Selection & WhatsApp Integration Implementation

## Overview

Successfully integrated real employee data into the order management system and implemented comprehensive WhatsApp messaging for both employees and customers when orders are assigned.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Real Employee Data Integration

- **Replaced Mock Data**: Removed hardcoded employee list with real data from the database
- **API Integration**: Used `useGetAllEmployeesQuery` to fetch active employees
- **Dynamic Loading**: Added loading states and error handling for employee data
- **Filtering**: Only shows active employees in the dropdown

### 2. Enhanced Order Assignment

- **Real Employee IDs**: Updated to use MongoDB `_id` instead of mock integer IDs
- **Department Display**: Shows employee name and department in dropdown
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately while API call is in progress
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

### 3. WhatsApp Messaging System

#### Employee Notifications

- **Assignment Message**: Detailed order information sent to assigned employee
- **Order Details**: Includes customer info, service type, total amount, and contact details
- **Professional Format**: Well-formatted message with emojis and clear structure

#### Customer Notifications

- **Assignment Confirmation**: Notifies customer when employee is assigned
- **Employee Information**: Includes assigned employee's name
- **Status Updates**: Confirms order is now in processing
- **Reassurance**: Professional messaging to build confidence

### 4. User Experience Improvements

- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback with detailed WhatsApp status
